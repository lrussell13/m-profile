            The average person makes 35,000 decisions each day. Each choice can carry consequences that leave lasting impressions for a lifetime: good and bad. Though at the time, Scott Fondren’s decision to entertain with his band instead of show up for his early morning interview with Jack Brown Cleaners seemed reckless. He would later find out just how taking the job at an embroidery shop would instead change the trajectory of his life forever.

A profile is a type of feature story that covers a particular person—or in my case, cat—and what they are currently up to. Oftentimes, magazines highlight celebrities with a profile.

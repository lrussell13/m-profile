            <h3>What Is Reverse Causality? Definition and Examples</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Reverse causality is a process where the outcome precedes the cause. This contrasts a traditional causality relationship between two variables and can describe phenomena in various industries.

          <p>
            Brunswick County has seen more than a 1,045 percent increase in resident cases of COVID-19 since early June, with a 17 percent increase in the past two weeks.

          <p>
            Amidst the bustling streets of East Cesar Chavez and Chicon sits a neighborhood icon, Mr. Natural, where, instead of big screen TVs, plants fill every corner. Instead of butter-filled meat and cheese dishes, plates topple over with meals rich in vitamins prone to make your mama proud.

            The average person makes 35,000 decisions each day. Each choice can carry consequences that leave lasting impressions for a lifetime: good and bad. Though at the time, Scott Fondren’s decision to entertain with his band instead of show up for his early morning interview with Jack Brown Cleaners seemed reckless. He would later find out just how taking the job at an embroidery shop would instead change the trajectory of his life forever.

            During the heart of the 2008 economic recession, Eve Trester-Wilson’s first inclination was to buy a laser cutter. With an absence of jobs across the nation, she decided to create her own.

            <h3>Profile Writing 101</h3>
            <p class="date">Cider Spoon Stories | Blog</p>

          <p>
            In addition to interning with Cider Spoon Stories, I write cat profiles for a local animal shelter, Austin Pets Alive (APA!). A profile is a type of feature story that covers a particular person—or in my case, cat—and what they are currently up to. Oftentimes, magazines highlight celebrities with a profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            But how do you successfully write a profile, capturing someone's total essence?
